# File-Mover
a simple program that moves files from subfolders to a parent folder

I threw this togeather to be able to orginize my photo library on my computer. So currently the program will search through a master parent folder, it will then add all the folders in the master folder to a list. The program will then enter each folder and then create a list of its subfolders. The program will then move selected filetypes from the subfolder to the parent folder. once it is complete it will go to the next folder in the master folder and repeat the process. If a naming conflict is found, the program will append a timestamp to the filename and then move the file.

this program was written in C#, this is currently a side project and will be updated.
